# Hand Gesture Recognition – AI Internship Project

This project is part of my **Artificial Intelligence Internship at SyntecxHub**, completed under **Task 3: Project 2**.  
It demonstrates a real-time **Hand Gesture Recognition System** using **Python, MediaPipe, OpenCV, Tkinter GUI**, and gesture-based system controls.
